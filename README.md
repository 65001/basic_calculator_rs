# Basic Calculator

This is an attempt to showcase the power of the
[nom](https://github.com/Geal/nom) library for Rust, and more in general, the
power of utilising parser combinators for solving various parsing problems.

# Problem Statement

I first came across the basic calculator problem statement in the [Peer to
Peer](http://peertopeer.io)
[session](http://peertopeer.io/videos/4-john-wiegley/) between Ollie Charles and
John Wiegley. For such a simple problem statement, I was impressed by how many
Haskell features were demonstrated in that video. That is why I decided to use
it as my first problem statement in learning Rust.

The [problem statement](problem_statement.pdf) itself is available as part of
this codebase.

# Solution

The solution pretty much mirrors the solution preseted by John in the above
linked video, except the language and library of choice.
